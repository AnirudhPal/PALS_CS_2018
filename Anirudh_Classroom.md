### What is Programming?

Programming is creating a sequence of instructions called a Program to enable the computer to do something. Lets do an activity to better understand this concept.

## Day 2

### Conversational Programming

The students give me *one line* instructions to get me from point A to B.

### Instructional Programming

The students give me *one word* instructions to get me from point A to B.

Instruction Set:

Instruction|Meaning
:-|-:
Forward| Move forward one step.
Backward| Move backward one step.
Right| Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot.
Left| Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot.

### Binary Programming

The students give me *one digit* instructions to get me from point A to B.

Instruction Set:

Instruction|Meaning
:-|-:
0| Move forward one step.
1| Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot.

### Human Sort

Human process instructions in a very complex but efficient manner. We are able to constantly observe change and thus sort ourselves rather quickly. Driving is a example of humans performing a complex task very easily.

### Selection Sort

We pick the a number and keep moving it till we find the right slot.

### Bubble Sort (Easier for Humans)

We compare pairs and swap them if needed.

### Algorithms, Instruction Sets and More

*Instruction Set* is a finite list of very specific operations. *Algorithm* is a precise rule specifying how to solve some problem.

## Day 3

### Install Cmder

Download -> [Cmder](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases/download/v1.3.6/cmder_mini.zip)

Click on *Show in folder*.

![]()

Right Click and then *Extract Here*.

![]()

Open Application.

![]()

### Secure Shell

> SSH or SecureShell is a application that allows you to remotely accesses other Linux computers. This allows people to share one single computer or work on another computer remotely.

Replace 'X' with user number and enter the command below. NOTE: This will only work in the Computer Labs during the camp!

``` bash
ssh UserX@10.185.1.169
```

Say *yes* if you get a prompt.

Enter password *1234*.

After running this your screen should look similar this.

### Source Control

> GIT is a application that allows exchange of code and is used to log modification to files that are shared among multiple users. We only use it to download source code.

Enter the command below.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/alexdantas/nSnake.git
```

After running this your screen should look like this.

![]()

### Compile

> Code on its own is just a bunch of text. It has to be translated so the machine can understand it. This process of translation is called compiling your code.

Enter the commands below.

``` bash
cd nSnake
make
```

After running this your screen should look like this.

![]()

### Execute

> At this point we have the code translated to what a machine can understand. But when does it start reading it? We have to tell it start reading the code and running the application. This process is called execution.

Enter the commands below.

``` bash
cd bin
./nsnake
```

After running this your screen should look like this.
