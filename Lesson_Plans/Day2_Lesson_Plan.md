## Description

### *Introduction:*

* State Lesson Objective.
* Establish Directives.

### *Activity 1 - Conversational Programming:*

We will continue the activity described in the last class with conversational directives from each student.

### *Activity 2 - Instructional Programming:*

Repeat the same with instructional directives. Forcing students to operate with an Instruction Set.

### *Activity 3 - Binary Programming:*

Then with binary directives. Promoting critical thinking to achieve the same task.

### *Activity 4 - Selection Sort and Bubble Sort:*

We will run through these two sorting algorithms with the help of number tags. This demonstrates the benefits and limitations of a Computers.
