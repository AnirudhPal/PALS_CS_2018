# Lesson # - Sorting Activity
## Goals
* Have the kids work together to be able to solve the challenges.
* Teach the kids how to solve problems like a programmer would. (One step at a time, Following a simple repeated process, etc.)

### Materials Needed
* [Number Cards](../Assets/SortingActivity/NumberCards.pdf)
* Room with more space

* [*Part 2*](#part-2)
* [*Part 3*](#part-3)



## Part 1
1. Print out [*Number Cards*](../Assets/SortingActivity/NumberCards.pdf).
2. Hand out the cards to the kids **randomly**.
3. Tell the kids to sort themselves in a straight line from smallest to largest number.
4. When they are ready, have them show you the cards and check to see if they are in order.

## Part 2
1. Tell the kids to sort themselves with the following **rules**:
    * You must remain in line.
    * You may only *swap* with the person next to you.
    * You may only show your card to the person next to you.
    * Only 1 swap at a time. In order to perform a swap, someone must state who they are swapping with. **If two people yell _"Swap!"_ at the same time then make them start over**(This is to teach how computers are *single instruction*, and can only perform one task at a time.)
Give them the option to work together and devise a strategy.
2. Shuffle and hand the cards at *random* to the kids. They should be in a straight line when they begin.
3. When they are ready, have them show you the cards and check to see if they are in order.
>In the end, the way they sort should _ideally_ be similar to that of **bubble sort**.


## Part 3
>The rules here are more strict to simulate that of how a computer would work.
1. Tell the kids to sort themselves with the following **rules**:
    * You must remain in line.
    * You must remain silent. The only way they may communicate is by whispering to the people next to you. Similar to that of the game _telephone_.
    * Only 1 swap at a time. Same as in **Part 2** 
    * You may swap with anybody in line this time.
    * You may only show your card to the person next to you.
Give them the option to work together and devise a strategy.
2. Shuffle and hand the cards at *random* to the kids. They should be in a straight line when they begin.
3. When they are ready, have them show you the cards and check to see if they are in order.
