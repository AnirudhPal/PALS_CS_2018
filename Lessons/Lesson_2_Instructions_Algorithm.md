## Conversational Programming

The students give me *one line* instructions to get me from point A to B.

## Instructional Programming

The students give me *one word* instructions to get me from point A to B.

Instruction Set:

Instruction|Meaning
:-|-:
Forward| Move forward one step.
Backward| Move backward one step.
Right| Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot.
Left| Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot.

## Binary Programming

The students give me *one digit* instructions to get me from point A to B.

Instruction Set:

Instruction|Meaning
:-|-:
0| Move forward one step.
1| Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot.

## Human Sort

A human processes instructions in a very complex but efficient manner. We are able to constantly observe change and thus sort ourselves rather quickly. Driving is a example of humans performing a complex task very easily.

## Selection Sort

We pick a number and keep moving it till we find the right slot.

## Bubble Sort (Easier for Humans)

We compare pairs and swap them if needed.

## Algorithms, Instruction Sets and More

*Instruction Set* is a finite list of very specific operations. *Algorithm* is a precise rule specifying how to solve some problem.
