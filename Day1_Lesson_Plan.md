## Description

### *Introduction:*

* Introduce Instructor.
* State Lesson Objective.
* Establish Directives.

### *Activity 1 - Mouse Accuracy:*

We will use a mouse game to ensure students are comfortable using a computer mouse. The results will influence future lesson plans. Any common errors will be addressed with a demonstration.

### *Activity 2 - Keyboard Accuracy:*

Similar to Activity 1, we will follow the same structure for a keyboard.

### *Activity 3 - Log Off and Log In:*

After getting familiar with a keyboard and a mouse we will put their practice to the test by asking them to log in to the system with the provided credentials and then navigate to a webpage. This will be timed to account for it in future lessons. 

### *Activity 4 - What is Programming? (If time permits):*

If the older kids make it through this process quickly, we will discuss what programming actually means using a small maze game. 

### *Conclusion:*

* Conclude Lesson Objectives
